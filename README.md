[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@javilujann/timemcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@javilujann/timemcp)


It contains a small MCP server program with two tools:
- getTime: returns the current timestamp
- readableTime: given a timestamp translates it into natural language.

### Connect via Smithery

There are two ways to use this MCP server, via smithery, using multiple clients such as cherry studio or VSCode. 

1. Via Streamable HTTP connection: you just need to use the URL provided by the smithery badge above, under the Connect section.
2. Via STDIO: again under the Connect section, click on the JSON button and copy the npx command in your client configuration file or settings.
